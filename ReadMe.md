This repo contains my project for the Practical Machine Learning course at Coursera for Data Science Specialization. The project quantifies how well people do their exercises regulary by analyzing data collected from accelerometers on exercise machine belts, forearm and dumbell of 6 individuals. The project will classify the performed exercise into five categories: Class A : exactly according to the specification
Class B: throwing the elbows to the front
Class C: lifting the dumbbell only halfway
Class D: lowering the dumbbell only halfway
Class E: throwing the hips to the front
